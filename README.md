📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior by transforming raw data into meaningful insights. The workflow includes data cleaning and reshaping using Google Colab, importing the processed data into SQL, performing data analysis using SQL queries, and finally creating an interactive dashboard based on the query results.

The goal of this project is to understand customer purchasing patterns, engagement trends, and key behavioral metrics to support data-driven business decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Google Colab (Python, Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL) – Data storage and analysis

Power BI / Tableau – Dashboard creation and visualization

CSV Dataset – Raw customer behavior data

📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Raw customer behavior data collected in CSV format

Dataset includes customer details, transactions, and engagement-related attributes

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Reshaping (Google Colab)

Performed the following preprocessing steps using Python:

Removed duplicate and null values

Standardized column names and data formats

Converted data types (dates, numerical values)

Created derived columns (total purchase value, visit frequency, etc.)

Reshaped data for better relational structure

📌 Output: Cleaned and structured dataset ready for database insertion

3️⃣ Data Import to SQL Database

Created database schema and tables

Imported cleaned data from Colab into SQL tables

Ensured data integrity using primary keys and constraints

4️⃣ Data Analysis Using SQL Queries

Analyzed customer behavior using SQL queries such as:

Customer purchase frequency analysis

Identification of high-value and repeat customers

Average order value and total revenue

Customer segmentation based on behavior

Time-based trend analysis

📌 These queries form the foundation for dashboard visualizations.

5️⃣ Dashboard Creation

Connected SQL database to visualization tool

Built interactive dashboards based on query outputs

Included KPIs and charts such as:

Total Customers

Revenue Trends

Repeat vs New Customers

Top Performing Customer Segments

Purchase Behavior Over Time

📈 Key Insights

Identified customer segments with high engagement

Analyzed purchasing patterns and peak sales periods

Detected churn-prone customers

Provided actionable insights to improve customer retention and marketing strategies

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data preprocessing to SQL-based analysis and dashboard visualization. It highlights the importance of data cleaning, structured querying, and visual storytelling in understanding customer behavior.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Automate data refresh using scheduled pipelines

Add predictive analysis for customer churn

Integrate real-time data sources

Enhance dashboard with advanced filters and drill-downs
